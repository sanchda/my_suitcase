Dave's Suitcase
===============

Make my life a little easier by putting my bash, vim, and tmux configurations in a common place.

The install script will create hooks at startup that will load these three files from the suitcase.  It only needs to be run once.  If the suitcase is updated from SVN, the changes will be automatically picked up by new shells.
